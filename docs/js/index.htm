<p>Welcome !</p>
<p>RunOrg is a database that stores information about <a href="/docs/js/people.htm">People</a> and their interactions with you and with each other. It is designed for access over HTTPS: rather than letting it sit behind your application server, you can let your users <a href="auth.htm">Authenticate</a> and interact with the database directly&amp;mdash;RunOrg will restrict the actions of every user based on their identity, according to your <a href="/docs/js/access.htm">Access</a> rules.</p>
<p>Among other things, you can:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Let people write <a href="/docs/js/posts.htm">Posts</a>, which can be standalone messages, replies to other messages or comments on arbitrary objects both inside and outside RunOrg.</li>
  <li> Create <a href="/docs/js/forms.htm">Forms</a> and ask people to fill them. RunOrg computes statistics for you.</li>
  <li> Send <a href="/docs/js/mail.htm">Mail</a>. RunOrg lets you track which are opened and includes links that authenticate recipients that click on it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some actions you can perform involve individual people, while others involve <a href="/docs/js/groups.htm">Groups</a> of people.</p>
<p>All of this happens inside a <a href="/docs/js/database.htm">Database</a>, and a single RunOrg server can host several independent databases.</p>
